* Protocol
Report in last 27 bytes of IRQ response

/Little endian/
/Least significant bit first/

** Initial state
Dongle is connected but tablet is not.

| 0040 |   | 00 | 00 | 0f | 80 | 80 | 80 | 80 | 00 |   | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 60 | 00 | 0f |
|------+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----|
| 0050 |   | 0f | ff | ff | 00 | 02 | 00 | 02 | 00 |   | 02 | 00 | 02 |    |    |    |    |    |

** Buttons
The gaps are probably reserved for other PlayStation inputs, e.g. L1, L2, L3,
R1, R2, R3. This isn't equipped with them though.

*** Byte 0x00
| Bit   |        3 |      2 |     1 |      0 |
|-------+----------+--------+-------+--------|
| State | Triangle | Circle | Cross | Square |

*** Byte 0x01
| Bit   |    4 |      1 |     0 |
|-------+------+--------+-------|
| State | Home | Select | Start |

** D-Pad
*** Byte 0x02
| Value |    0x0F | 0x00 |       0x01 |  0x02 |         0x03 | 0x04 |        0x05 | 0x06 |      0x07 |
|-------+---------+------+------------+-------+--------------+------+-------------+------+-----------|
| State | Neutral |   Up | Up + Right | Right | Down + Right | Down | Down + Left | Left | Left + Up |


*** Bytes 0x07 - 0x0A
Whole bytes are set to 0xFF. Why do this when we have Byte 0x02? It adds 4 bytes
for nothing... Theory: 0x02 is derived from these by the dongle and all tablet
data is passed through, resulting in some garbage data.

| Byte  |  0x07 | 0x08 | 0x09 | 0x0A |
|-------+-------+------+------+------|
| State | Right | Left |   Up | Down |

** Digitizer
*** Byte 0x0B - 0x0C
This communicates the type of detection
+ For Pinch Data, byte 0x0B seems related to rotation, 0x0C seems related to
  distance. There is probably trigonometry involved.
| Value | 0x0000 | 0x4000 |     0x8000 | Anything Else |
|-------+--------+--------+------------+---------------|
| State |   Idle |    Pen | One Finger | Pinch Data    |

*** Byte 0x0F - 0x12
Position data
The digitizer space is broken up into a grid, 0x0F and 0x10 describe the grid
square of the touch point. 0x11 and 0x12 describe the position of the touch
point relative to the top left corner of the grid square in px.

A grid square is 256px x 256px but since 1920x1080 doesn't divide into blocks of
that size, the last rows and columns will never reach 256.

+ Absolute X: Row * 256 + X
+ Absolute Y: Column * 256 + Y

| Byte | 0x0F |   0x10 | 0x11 | 0x12 |
|------+------+--------+------+------|
| Data |  Row | Column |    X |    Y |

When there is no value, bytes 0x0F and 0x10 have value 0x0F and bytes 0x11 and
0x12 have value 0xFF

** Pen Pressure Sensor
*** Byte 0x0D
+ My device reports a minimum of 0x6E (now 0x6F)
+ 256-110 = 146 possible pressure values
  + I've seen reports of different minimum pressure values, so there may be
    different ranges across devices.
  + After tinkering, I managed to *raise* the minimum value on my own device.
    The mechanism is not reliable, cleaning may help. Raising the threshold may
    improve reliability but reduces pressure resolution.
    + Cleaning restored performance, thresholding at 128 is advisable because 128 is a nice number :)
+ Could be used to determine connection status
+ x > y, y >= 96: Pressure% = 1 + x - y / (256 - y) * 100
  + x is the value of byte 0x0D
  + y is a defined threshold

| Value | 0x60 | x > 0x60 |
|-------+------+----------|
| Data  | Idle | Pressure |

** Accelerometer
Each axis is described by a pair of bytes. The first byte gives the amount of
tilt ranging from 0x00 to 0xFF. The second byte gives the sign or direction.

*** X Axis
+ Left: 0x01
+ Right: 0x02

| Byte |   0x13 | 0x14 |
|------+--------+------|
| Data | Amount | Sign |

*** Y Axis
+ Away: 0x01
+ Toward: 0x02

| Byte |   0x15 | 0x16 |
|------+--------+------|
| Data | Amount | Sign |

*** Z Axis
+ Facing up: 0x01
+ Facing down: 0x02

| Byte |   0x17 | 0x18 |
|------+--------+------|
| Data | Amount | Sign |

** Unknown
*** Bytes 0x03 - 0x06
Always each 0x80
+ There are four LEDs to indicate controller number, related?

*** Byte 0x0E

*** Bytes 0x19 and 0x1A
Always 0x00 and 0x02
+ Same format as the axial pairings
+ Defines the neutral value?
