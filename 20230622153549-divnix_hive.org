#+title: Divnix Hive

Hive is a framework for managing nixos and home-manager configurations. Because
it is [[id:566c86b0-f2bd-4c17-a572-58cd567dba4e][Paisano]] based, many Hive skills are transferable with [[id:dd27fcb4-7891-444f-940e-d914a9cba507][std]]. In fact, Hive
can be used in conjunction with std.
